Experiment 3 – Multi-Page Extension Using React Router

In Experiment 3, we extended the previously developed portfolio website by adding an additional webpage and implementing navigation using React Router. A new “Projects” page was created to showcase major projects such as the AI Stress Predictor, Government Scheme Chatbot, and Full Stack Docker Application. We integrated React Router to enable seamless navigation between the Home and Projects pages without reloading the website, thereby converting the application into a multi-page React SPA (Single Page Application). To ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages deployment, HashRouter was implemented for stable routing. The UI design consistency was maintained across both pages by reusing common components such as Navbar and Footer. This experiment helped us understand client-side routing, dynamic page rendering, multi-page architecture in React, and deployment considerations for static hosting platforms. It enhanced our understanding of scalable frontend application development and real-world routing implementation.
